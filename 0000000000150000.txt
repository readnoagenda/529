jd;Probably we should also mention.. yeah. We have a couple of issues with a couple of missing shows ...

ac;Well not really missing shows because we are going to fill them up with some outstanding content. There's no doubt about it.

jd;Yeah.

ac;But we have decided to take two shows off this year. During the summer. Two whole shows.

jd;Hey wait a minute. Let's stop for a second. I want to point out to everybody OH NO! I want to point out to everybody that we have been doing the show for close to six years. Our six year anniversary is in October.

ac;Coming up!
