jd;And we've never taken one show off!

ac;Hold on! Hold on!

jd;Except we did a clip show for Christmas a couple of years ago.

ac;And when I got married everyone gave me a show off. Remember that?

jd;I don't remember that.

ac;Yeah! It was almost a year ago when Micky and I got married.

jd;Is that when we did 200.5?

ac;I think that's when we did three-hundred .. I don't remember .. I don't know how many episodes ago that was.

jd;Yeah but we actually did a show.

ac;No, no we still have a show, yeah, of course. It's not like we are going to go dark, right?

jd;No. We won't do that!
