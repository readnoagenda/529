ac;So the only shows that we are not doing are July twenty fifth and July twenty eighth. And then we will be doing two shows from Amsterdam and both field tests with the new box.

jd;The twenty-eighth may be the Indianapolis Nascar event.

ac;Oh really?

jd;I might just go down to that. See if anyone can .. if we can get anyone to ... we have a contact within the organization -- not within the organization, but is in the publicity world surrounding Nascar to use ... to get a No Agenda sticker on one of these...

ac;Yeah! How cool is that?!

jd;...probably a nation-wide car.

ac;Yeah! I love it! I love it!
