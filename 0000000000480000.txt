ac;There's guys who can sketch you perfectly.

jd;Yeah.

ac;You look fantastic. It's like, "That's you!" They can do it caricature for all I care.

jd;Yeah.

ac;But the courtroom sketches that are being done, it can only be to hide the fact that there's no court session going on. There's just nothing. Have you seen the reports about this - about Tsarnaev

jd;No, yeah. The Tsarnaev stuff is quite interesting. The latest is that it may not be him.

ac;It's not him! Of course it's not! Why else would you not allow cameras in the courtroom?
