ac;I was going to say. There is not a single person who was able to sneak in an iphone or a camera or something? Everyone went through a metal detector? is that what happened? Did everyone go through a slave scanner?

jd;Yeah. They had to give up all their stuff. You can't be in there on the iphone.

ac;Right. Well I'm just not, I'm not accepting it anymore. It is no longer acceptable in the 21st century to not have photo - at least a photograph of what is taking place in the courtroom! It invigorates conspiracy theory.
