ac;Right! So stop it!

jd;There is not trial! It's not taking place!

ac;Stop it! Prove it to me! And by the way everyone is saying well the guy who we think is there who we have no evidence, no video or photographic evidence. He's not the guy! He's taller. He speaks with a Russian accent...

jd;This is  why he is not guilty!

ac;Yeah! Of course he is not guilty! It's not him!

jd;I didn't do anything! What am I even doing here?
