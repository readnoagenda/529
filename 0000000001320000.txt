c1;He may have been misguided but he certainly was patriotic. What did this guy do? He goes to China and then he goes to Russia. Both countries that would like to replace us on top of the global totem pole. And Russia certainly under Putin is far from being friendly to the United States. So what are his motives? Who's he trying to appeal to? Who are his allies that he made his choice? In other words I am very skeptical about his motivation.
