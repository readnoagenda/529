c;Making absolutely certain that all the safeguards are being properly observed. Now.  Having said all that.  You'll remember when I made that speech a couple of weeks ago about the need for us to shift out of a perpetual war mindset.  I specifically said that one of the things that we're going to have to discuss and debate is "how are we striking this balance between the need to keep the American people safe and our concerns about privacy?" Because there are some trade-offs involved.  I welcome this debate and I think it's healthy for our democracy.  I think it's a sign of maturity.
