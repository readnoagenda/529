;Are you kidding me?! So I am like wait a minute. And you know me, when it comes to any good foundation I am all over it. So I am looking for the 990s of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Doesn't exist because they are not a real foundation. What they do though is they take 8% of all donations they bundle which they hand on to the organizations they benefit. The organizations are Wikileaks, The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Center for Public Integrity, Truth Out, Mock Rock News, National Security Archive and The Uptake. That's who they are promoting this week. And they say right there they take 8% of all donations to, I guess, pay for their own salaries. So who's really behind The Freedom of the Press Foundation? Well it says it right there on their website.
