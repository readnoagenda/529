ac;Not bad for a non-profit blog! Now I have to say they also publish - they have been publishing for a long time. Very interesting history. Michael Moore was their editor-got into a huge fight, he sued them for 2 million dollars. They settled out of court. This is... if you look at their reporting on 9/11 they are totally all-in on the 9/11 Commission Report. They laugh about the truther movies. They laugh about the truther movement. They, of course, do not report who's donating this 9 almost 10 million dollars other than they break it up
