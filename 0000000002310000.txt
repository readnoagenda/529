ac;ac;The foundation for national progress is, they don't even have a website, it is MotherJones<dot>com. Who, um so, they are a nonprofit. They had a nice nine million dollar income.  Not bad for a non-profit blog! Now I have to say they also publish - they have been publishing for a long time. Very interesting history. Michael Moore was their editor-got into a huge fight, he sued them for 2 million dollars. They settled out of court. This is... if you look at their reporting on 9/11 they are totally all-in on the 9/11 Commission Report. They laugh about the truther movies. They laugh about the truther movement. They, of course, do not report who's donating this 9 almost 10 million dollars other than they break it up:  2 million is for advertising. 4 million is for programs that they do where.. so they have specific I guess fund drives ect, and then there's another 4 million-that's kinda how roughly how it's split up- that comes from directly from donors who they by law do not have to mention. Ah but we do see that the George Soros Open Society Institute has donated at least six hundred thousand dollars
