ac;Well all they are is a front group for Mother Jones essentially. Just to go collect money and then they say that they are giving this money to Wikileaks but they are not. They collect the money, they take 8% - this Freedom of the Press Foundation - they give the 92% to Mother Jones and I guess Mother Jones then gives it to Wikileaks although I could find no evidence of that in their Form 990. So I am not so sure that they do that. Or maybe they do but this Freedom of the Press Foundation is not a real foundation. At least they are not registered with the IRS as such or anything that I could find. But this group (??) Oh man I have suspected her for a long time. Now I am sure. This is a spook club!  I'll say it!
