ac;yeah they said we can't handle you right now, which is not unusual which is probably why he said.. you see Ok... I am a pilot I get to say this with authority when you want to change something a flight plan something unplanned you have to communicate with air traffic control and if you know the guy or the gal you can say "hey you know  I need you to ... could you please give we some," actually they say "For your consideration", this is how you talk with air traffic control. "For your consideration this is what I'd like to do," but if you don't know the person you have to say either "we have.." You can't declare an emergency you cannot declare an emergency if you don't have one that can loose your licence for good, but you can say "yeah we've got something going on here that we don't really like, I've got a little fuel indication issue" or "I've got a sick passenger," which you know I didn't say he'd a heart attack
