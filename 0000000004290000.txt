ac;You can't complain. Do not look

jd;I'm not complaining. I'm just giving - I'm chiding them.

ac;Chiding them. Okay. Anyway we appreciate it so -- it's important to have a live audience while we are doing this show. It does make a difference. It feels different. Also thank you to our artists. Thank you to Patrick Buijs who provided the artwork for No Agenda Show Episode 528. This is 529 can't wait to see what we get at No Agenda Art Generator dot com. And we have I believe one or two executive producers to thank today on the show.
