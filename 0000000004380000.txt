jd;Oh, ok, 752 52.  I just got repaid for an old debt.  It means I can chip in a bit more this time.  Hopefully this helps the doldrums of summer and also gets me my Dukedom.

ac;Oh.

jd;So he's going to be the Duke Of Oregon

ac;Nice

jd;He defers to the peerage officer for how big a chunk of the NAFTA territory I am granted.

ac;Take all you want.  First come, first served this week

jd;We'll discuss this over some email, but he'll probably end up with Jefferson
