jd;Warren Carroll, Seatle, Washington $333.33.  The No Agenda Show has taught me how to question what I see on tv.  Apparently.

ac;Um huh

jd;Makes ME question what I see on tv, read in the news and hear from other people, which is the real problem, by the way.  In the value for value world, my donation my donation does not balance..when you talk to people about this sort of thing, just say 'you know, I've listened to the clip of the guy in the cockpit asking to land in Austria.  How is that being forced down, when he ASKED to land?
