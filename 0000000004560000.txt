jd;Oh, you think Glenn's just going to block me?

ac;Oh yeah.  He's not pure.

jd;I would do the same.  I block people left and right.

ac;But, you actually like to respond to someone and go 'You suck!  Blocked!'

jd;(laughs) You suck..

ac;I've seen it

jd;Yeah, I do that once in a while.  I usually just block, but sometimes I say blocked.

ac;I always look and if someone has like a hundred followers, I don't even respond.  I'm like, 'screw you?'
