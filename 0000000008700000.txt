ac;..the Nagalski's, three brothers.  The Nagalski brothers would all team up on me.  And then as I went to judo class and I was like, okay I'll learn how to kick their ass.  And at the judo class, the first class, the instructor like scared the shit out of me and I didn't want to go back any more.  It's like I have a life of bullying.  It's just no good.  Now I have guns.  C'mon.
