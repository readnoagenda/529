jd;- give you a bunch of drugs. They all know - the animal - you better get you take these drugs! And so they give you all these packets of drugs for the poor animal and that you are supposed to make them take and every - they have to go back for a follow up - which is another- it's costs as much as it costs to go to a regular doctor.

It's just unbelievable.
