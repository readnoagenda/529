ac;Do you think that a drone strike would have worked?

jd;A drone strike hitting the crude oil? Yes, that would work.

ac;Okay. Just a thought.

jd;So what you're implying is that we just drone the damn thing

ac;Possibly. It's a possibility.

jd;I'm telling you right now there's no way for one of those - these things crash comm- not commonly but when they do crash  I've never heard of one exploding. It's not possible!

ac;And taking out - like killing twenty people. I mean this thing exploded and it took out, you know, sixty homes or something.
